This code is a "skin", "plug-in", "screen" for the Hello World tool.
That tool was exposed by Janek [ajjjjjjjj](https://github.com/ajjjjjjjj) , an openTX port programmer for the Flysky-I6x radio [OpenI6X](https://github.com/OpenI6X/opentx) . It wouldn't be possible without him.

It is only inspired by other projects that run in Lua Script.
It does not run by itself, it must be added when compiling the OpenI6X port. More on this in the root repository.

It is severely limited by the hardware sufficiency of the radio, call it what you will, and it is not possible to expect much from it.

Also, this is my very first time in clang, so hate me as much as you can.
